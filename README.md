## ✨ Enterprise-Grade Features

* 📊 **Automated Statistical Profiling:** Instantly processes `CSV`, `Excel`, and `JSON` files. Automatically calculates null ratios, cardinality, and detects pandas data types for up to millions of rows in seconds.
* 🤖 **AI-Powered Data Dictionary:** Leverages **Groq Llama-3.1 API** to generate rich, contextual business definitions and actionable cleaning recommendations for every column.
* 💻 **AI SQL DDL Generator:** Automatically generates `CREATE TABLE` scripts for PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, Oracle, and SQL Server.
* 🧼 **Smart Data Cleaning Studio:** One-click automated imputation for missing values and robust **IQR-based outlier mitigation** to ensure pristine data health.
* 💬 **Conversational Analytics (Agentic Sandbox):** Chat with your dataset in natural language! The AI translates your questions into Python Pandas code, executes it in a secure sandbox, and returns 100% mathematically accurate answers.
* 🗺️ **Multi-File ERD Visualizer:** Upload multiple datasets simultaneously. The semantic engine intelligently maps Primary and Foreign keys to generate stunning, interactive **Mermaid.js Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack & Architecture

SchemaScribe AI utilizes a robust Client-Server architecture combining high-performance data processing with cutting-edge Large Language Models.

* **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism), JavaScript, Chart.js, Mermaid.js
* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn 
* **Data Engine:** Pandas, NumPy (for high-speed vectorized calculations)
* **AI Engine:** Groq Cloud API (Llama-3.1 8B Instant)

### 💡 Why an "Agentic Approach"?
Instead of passing millions of rows to an LLM (which exceeds token limits and causes math hallucinations), SchemaScribe AI uses an **Agentic execution loop**. The AI acts as a planner—it reads the schema, writes Pandas code, and the backend executes it. This guarantees **100% mathematical accuracy** while maintaining the conversational ease of a chatbot.
